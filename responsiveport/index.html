                <p id="bio">My name is Derrick Hideo Davis. I was born and raised in Salt Lake City Utah. I was drawn to music from an early age.  As a child, I would spend several hours a day composing songs on the piano.  Later in life my passion for music evolved from piano composition to full song production. Over the course of my life I have provided songs for podcasts, local commercials, independent video games, singers, and youtube channels.  I could reel off more facts about myself, however, I don't think you would be any closer to knowing me. Instead, I will show you how I think about the world. <br/> 
                    Most people think of music as all creativity and no logic.  This simply isn't true.  The component parts of music such as harmony, melody, and rhythm must be coordinated to make a coherent song. In a sense, music is equal parts creativity and logic.  In the same vein, painters use geometry in their craft. I am convinced that there is no form of art without an underlying logical system that serves as a framework. <br/>
                    To the untrained eye, computer code looks like a hodgepodge of letters, numbers, and signs. My eyes were untrained until I found my second passion. Most people would say programming is cold and calculated with no room for creativity. They are only half right.  Although most languages are unforgiving when it comes to syntax, writing the actual code is only half of programming. In reality, almost anything you can conceive of can be written in code.  The door for creativity is wide open in the world of coding. <br/>
                    To someone who is unfamiliar to either, sheet music and computer code are equally baffling.  To me, they are equally beautiful.   </p>
